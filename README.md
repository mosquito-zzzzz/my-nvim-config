# my-nvim-config

My LazyVim based nvim config, feel free to copy/fork/add changes

I aim to set it up for a easy understanding to any user.

With C/C++, Golang, and Web development from the go.

If there is anything you want to chang,
refer to the [LazyVim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation)
